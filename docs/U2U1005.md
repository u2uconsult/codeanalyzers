# U2U1005: Implement internal interfaces

Category : Performance

Severity : Info

## Cause

An internal interface with not attributes applied to it has only one implementation (or no implementations at all).

## Rule Description

When an interface has only one implementation, all instances of the interface are instances of that one implementation.

The interface adds no value, on the contrary. While all instances are of the same type, the compiler and JIT compiler don't know this,
and they can't optimize for it. Method calls over an interface are less efficient than direct method calls.

## How to Fix Violations

Add more implementations, or remove the interface. All fields and variables of the interface type should be declared to be of the implementing type.

## Example
