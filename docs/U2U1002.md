# U2U1002: Method can be declared static

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

A method

- is not accessing instance state
- is not virtual, abstract or override
- has no attributes applied to it
- implements no interface methods
- is not visible to COM
- is not extern
- is not called through a delegate

but is not `static`.

## Rule Description

An instance method has an implicit parameter: the reference to `this`. However, this method does not use this reference, and it looks like
there is no excuse to have it. By making the method `static`, the reference to `this` does not need to be passed.

## How to Fix Violations

Use the code fix to make the method `static`.

## Example

Take this method:

    public double Circumference(double radius)
    {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }

Make the method `static`:

    public static double Circumference(double radius)
    {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
