# U2U1012: Parameter types should be specific

Category : Performance

Severity : Info

## Cause

A parameter to a method that is not visible outside its assembly is declared to be of a more general type than the type of its callers arguments.

## Rule Description

For performance reasons, you want to be a precise ans you possibly can when you provide type information to the compiler. For example, when all
callers to a method pass `List<int>` arguments, and the method declares the parameter to be of type `IEnumerable<int>`, the compiler doesn't have all
the information when it needs to optimize the method body. For example, `foreach` loops inside the method body couldn't use the efficient 
`List<T>` implementation.

## How to Fix Violations

Use the code fix to change the parameter declaration to use the most specific type.

## Example
