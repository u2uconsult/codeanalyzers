# U2U1003: Avoid declaring methods used in delegate constructors static

Category : Performance

Severity: Warning

## Cause

A method is static, but it is called through a delegate.

## Rule Description

Calling a delegate is much more efficient when the method being called is an instance method. The performance difference is 
most important for short methods that are called a lot, as may be the case in LINQ queries.

## How to Fix Violations

Turn the method into an instance method, or if it is used in only one place, consider converting it into a lambda.

## Example

Consider this [BenchmarkDotNet](http://benchmarkdotnet.org/) benchmark:

    public class ToMeasure
    {
        private readonly Action Static;
        private readonly Action Instance;

        public ToMeasure()
        {
            Static = StaticDoNothing;
            Instance = InstanceDoNothing;
        }

        [Benchmark]
        public void MeasureStatic()
        {
            Static();
        }

        [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
        public void MeasureInstance()
        {
            Instance();
        }

        private static void StaticDoNothing() { }
        private void InstanceDoNothing() { }
    }

This is the result summary on one of our test machines:

    BenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.6, OS=Windows 10 Redstone 1 (10.0.14393)
    Processor=Intel Core i7 CPU 860 2.80GHz (Nehalem), ProcessorCount=8
    Frequency=2727695 Hz, Resolution=366.6099 ns, Timer=TSC
      [Host]     : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1648.0
      DefaultJob : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.6.1648.0
    
    
              Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |
    ---------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|
       MeasureStatic | 2.131 ns | 0.0602 ns | 0.0563 ns |   1.74 |     0.04 |
     MeasureInstance | 1.226 ns | 0.0061 ns | 0.0051 ns |   1.00 |     0.00 |

In this example, calling the static method takes 74% more time than calling the instance method.
