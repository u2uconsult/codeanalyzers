# U2U1003: Avoid declaring methods used in delegate constructors static

Category : Performance

Severity: Warning

## Cause

A method is static, but it is called through a delegate.

## Rule Description

Calling a delegate is much more efficient when the method being called is an instance method. The performance difference is 
most important for short methods that are called a lot, as may be the case in LINQ queries.

## How to Fix Violations

Turn the method into an instance method, or if it is used in only one place, consider converting it into a lambda.
