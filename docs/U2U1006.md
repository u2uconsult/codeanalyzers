# U2U1006: Await tasks correctly

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

This documentation is under construction.

## Rule Description



## How to Fix Violations



## Example

Consider this method:

    protected override async Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	{
		HttpContext.Current.User = Authenticate(request.Headers.Authorization);

		return await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
	}

Use the code fix to change the method to:

    protected override Task<HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
	{
		HttpContext.Current.User = Authenticate(request.Headers.Authorization);

		return base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);
	}

This method needs no asynchronous state machine, and the task returned from the base method does not need to be unwrapped only to have
its content packaged up in a new task to be returned.
