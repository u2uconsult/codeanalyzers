# U2U1015: Do not index an array multiple times within a loop body

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

An array is indexed multiple times with the same index within a loop body.

## Rule Description

Indexing into an array has a small but non-zero cost. With ref local variables, code can be written to incur the cost only once,
without having to sacrifice readability or going unsafe.

## How to Fix Violations

Compute the reference to the array element once and store it in a ref local variable.

## Example

Consider this method:

    private static void Sqrt(double[] array)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
        {
            if (array[i] > 0)
            {
                array[i] = Math.Sqrt(array[i]);
            }
        }
    }

The array is indexed three times within the loop body, twice read, once written. This can be avoided by using a ref local variable:

    private static void Sqrt(double[] array)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < array.Length; i++)
        {
            ref double element = ref array[i];

            if (element > 0)
            {
                element = Math.Sqrt(element);
            }
        }
    }
