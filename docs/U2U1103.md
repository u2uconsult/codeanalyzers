# U2U1103: Index strings correctly

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

A string is manipulated at the individual character level in an inefficient way.

- IndexOf, LastIndexOf or Contains is called with a single-character string as the first parameter
- Replace is called to replace a single-character string by another single-character string
- Substring is used to obtain a single-character string

## Rule Description

In most cases, manipulating character is much more efficient than manipulating single-character strings.
