# U2U1209: Use dictionaries efficiently

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

You guard an indexer into a dictionary with a call to `ContainsKey(TKey)`.

## Rule Description

Do not guard an indexer into a dictionary with a call to `ContainsKey(TKey)`; use `TryGetValue(TKey, out TValue)` instead.

Calling `ContainsKey(TKey)` needs to do some work to find whether the given key is present in the dictionary.
When subsequently indexing into the dictionary, that work essentially needs to be repeated.
You can avoid that double work by using `TryGetValue(TKey, out TValue)` instead.

## How to Fix Violations

Use `TryGetValue(TKey, out TValue)`

## Example

Consider the following code

```csharp
if (dictionary.ContainsKey(key))
{
	var value = dictionary[key];
	// use value
}
```

Rewrite it as follows:

```csharp
if (dictionary.TryGetValue(key, out var value))
{
	// use value
}
```
