# U2U1021: Field types should not cause boxing

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

A private field is of a reference type, but it is only assigned instances of value types, which may cause the values to be boxed.

## Rule Description

Whenever an instance of a value type is converted to an instance of a reference type, it needs to be boxed. This applies to all
reference types, not just `object`, but also interfaces. The only exception is an instance of `Nullable<T>` without a value. Boxing such a 
null value will not actually allocate memory, but return a null reference instead.

Boxing is not the only problem though. Because the method has less information about the actual type of the value, opportunities for
optimizing the machine code are often reduced.

## How to Fix Violations

Use the code fix to change the field type to reflect the type of assigned values.
