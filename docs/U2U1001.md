# U2U1001: Stateless classes can be static

Category : Performance

Severity : Info

## Cause

A class 

- has no instance state, 
- is not inherited from, 
- has no attributes applied to it, 
- has no base class;
- implements no interfaces,
- has no virtual methods,
- overrides no object methods (ToString, Equals, GetHashCode)

but the class is not declared `static`.

## Rule Description

Non-static classes have a constructor (or several constructors) that you need to call to create an instance, which allocates memory, 
in order to be able to call instance methods.

It looks like you don't need that constructor, and can make all your methods static.

## How to Fix Violations

Add instance state, or make the class static.

## Example

Take this class:

    class CircleMath
	{
        public double Circumference(double radius)
        {
            return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
        }
	}

This class implicitely has a default constructor that you need to call, before you can call the Circumference method.
However, we don't need that constructor, so let's remove it:

    static class CircleMath
	{
        public static double Circumference(double radius)
        {
            return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
        }
	}
