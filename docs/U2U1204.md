# U2U1204: Do not implicitly convert an `IQueryable<T>` to an `IEnumerable<T>`

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

A value of an `IQueryable<T>` type is implicitly converted to an `IEnumerable<T>` type.

## Rule Description

When a query of an `IQueryable<T>` type is converted to an `IEnumerable<T>` type,
further query compositions will not be executed by the query provider, which may have significant
perfomance impact.

The rule is triggered by

- assignment expressions where a value of an `IQueryable<T>` type is assigned to a variable of an `IEnumerable<T>` type
- variable declarations of an `IEnumerable<T>` type that are initialized with a value of an `IQueryable<T>` type
- a function with a result of an `IEnumerable<T>` type that returns a value of an `IQueryable<T>` type

## How to Fix Violations

Don't convert, or make the conversion explicit if it was intended, e.g. by calling `.AsEnumerable()`.
