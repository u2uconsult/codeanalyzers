# U2U1010: Internal leaf classes can be sealed

Category : Performance

Severity : Info

## Cause

A class is not inherited from, but the class is not declared `sealed`.

## Rule Description

When you declare a class `sealed`, it is impossible to inherit from it. That information can be used by the JIT compiler to generate
more efficient machine code. For example, it becomes easier to devirtualize virtual methods, and even inline them at the call site.

## How to Fix Violations

Use the code fix to make the class sealed.
