# U2U1008: Parentheses can be used to enable constant evaluation

Category : Performance

Severity : Info

## Cause

An expression is structured in such a way that constant folding is not possible, but can be modified to enable
constant folding by using parentheses.

## Rule Description

The C# compiler always respects the order of the operations of the C# program, even when through associativity of the
operatios constant folding could be applied. By inserting parentheses you can enable the compiler to apply the optimization.

Note that by changing the order of the operations, rounding errors in floating point operations can accumulate differently, and
yield different results. That is not the case for intgeral operations.

## How to Fix Violations

Insert parentheses to enable constant folding.

## Example

Take this method:

    public static double Circumference(double radius)
    {
        const double pi = Math.PI;
        return radius * 2 * pi;
    }

It is compiled into the following IL:

    .method public hidebysig static float64 Circumference(float64 radius) cil managed 
    {
        .maxstack 8
    
        ldarg.0
        ldc.r8 2
        mul
        ldc.r8 3.1415926535897931
        mul
        ret
    }

Parentheses can be inserted to change the order of the operations and enable constant folding:

    public static double Circumference(double radius)
    {
        const double pi = Math.PI;
        return radius * (2 * pi);
    }

Which results in:

    .method public hidebysig static float64 Circumference(float64 radius) cil managed 
    {
        .maxstack 8

        ldarg.0
        ldc.r8 6.2831853071795862
        mul
        ret
    }

Notice how constant folding has been applied.
