# U2U1100: Compare strings correctly

Category : Performance

Severity : Warning

## Cause

Strings are compared in an inefficient way, for example:

- strings are tested for equality using a Compare method
- a string is converted to uppercase or lowercase in order to be compared
- a substring is allocated in order to be compared
- a string is compared to an empty string

## Rule Description

This documentation is under construction.

## How to Fix Violations

Follow the recommendation in the violation message.

## Example

Consider this [BenchmarkDotNet](http://benchmarkdotnet.org/) benchmark:

    public class ToMeasure
    {
        string a = "";
        string b = "b";
        string c = null;

        bool r;

        [Benchmark]
        public void EqualsString()
        {
            r = a == "" | b == "" | c == "";
        }

        [Benchmark(Baseline = true)]
        public void EqualsLength()
        {
            r = a?.Length == 0 | b?.Length == 0 | c?.Length == 0;
        }
    }

In the code above, strings are tested for emptyness in two ways. In `EqualsString`, they are commpared to `""`. In `EqualsLength`, their `Length` is compared to `0`.

This is the result summary on one of our test machines:

    BenchmarkDotNet=v0.10.6, OS=Windows 10 Redstone 2 (10.0.15063)
    Processor=Intel Core i7 CPU 860 2.80GHz (Nehalem), ProcessorCount=8
    Frequency=2727695 Hz, Resolution=366.6099 ns, Timer=TSC
      [Host]     : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.2102.0
      DefaultJob : Clr 4.0.30319.42000, 64bit RyuJIT-v4.7.2102.0
    
    
           Method |     Mean |     Error |    StdDev | Scaled | ScaledSD |
    ------------- |---------:|----------:|----------:|-------:|---------:|
     EqualsString | 6.643 ns | 0.1169 ns | 0.1093 ns |   2.98 |     0.09 |
     EqualsLength | 2.228 ns | 0.0639 ns | 0.0598 ns |   1.00 |     0.00 |

Both methods do the same thing, but comparing to an empty string is three times slower than comparing the length to 0.
